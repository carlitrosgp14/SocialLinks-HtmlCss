git ad## Overview

In Web Challenge 3, we used HTML and CSS to design a simple user interface that displays a social links profile. This project helped reinforce fundamental web development concepts such as layout, structure, and styling. By building a responsive and clean design, I gained a clearer understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create user-friendly interfaces. It also strengthened my ability to research solutions and apply best practices in frontend development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to style divs to look and behave like buttons using CSS properties such as width, padding, background color, and border-radius. I also understood how divs inside a container can be sized from 1% to 100% depending on design goals or client requirements. This helped me see how structure and styling work together to achieve a desired UI outcome. Practicing this reinforced my understanding of layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy in web design.
